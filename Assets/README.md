# Card creator

## Symbols

You can insert different symbols into cards by using a specific format:
- {1} single action
- {2} two actions
- {3} three actions
- {R} reaction
- {critical_success}
- {success}
- {miss}
- {critical_miss}
- {power_up}

## Metadata

Define metada at the start of the card by using the format `key: value`. Once the parser find anything different than that, it will no longer parse those ocurrences as metadata for that card.
